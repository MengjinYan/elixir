## Final Poject Proposal

### Summary

Summary of all the latter sections

### Background

As nowadays the video consumers are becoming ubiquitous online, so is the need for a fast video analysis framework. The recent advances in machine learning methods enables many possibilities in this new area. Recent research by CMU on the [Scanner project](https://github.com/scanner-research/scanner) provides such a framework implemented using (ASK HERE)

[TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) is a open-source machine learning library which provides APIs in a lot of languages including Python, C++ and Go. The design and implementation of TensorFlow is similar to those of Scanner, which enables the possibliity of implementing Scanner on top of TensorFlow.

To implement Scanner on top of TensorFlow would ... (ASK HERE)

### Challenges

What are the challenges?

To demonstrate that the problem is not easy

### Resources

On the Scanner side of this project, the documentations and open-source code are listed online for our reference. The paper is provided to us to read, and as CMU students, we both can ask for help from the author of Scanner.

On the TensorFlow side, the documentation online is very helpful. Also, as a popular open-source framework, third-party online information related to TensorFlow about it is plentiful.

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/MengjinYan/parallel-final-project/edit/master/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for
